# Space vs Ocean

Two competing players are shown a 3x3 grid of images. It is the goal of one player to make the grid look like space; it is the goal of the other player to make the grid look like the ocean. The players take turns manipulating the grid. After the round is over, a tensorFlow model classifies the grid as either space or the ocean. Game states (grids) are reused and made only to support a greater number of concurrent players.

Made with JavaScript and socket.io.
